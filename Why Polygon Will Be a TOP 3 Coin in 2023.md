# 🚀 Why Polygon Could Reach the Top 3 by 2023

Polygon is currently the number 8 crypto project on CoinMarketCap, and I believe it could reach the top 3 in the near future—perhaps even in 2023. Now, this might sound overly optimistic, but after hearing my three-part thesis on Polygon, you might just agree. Let’s dive in!

## 🏆 Part 1: Impressive Accomplishments

Polygon has some standout achievements that set it apart from other chains:

1. **ZK EVM Roll-Up** 🏎️
   - Polygon’s ZK EVM Roll-Up is 100x faster than Ethereum, 90% cheaper in terms of gas fees, and more secure and efficient than existing Roll-Ups like Optimism and Arbitrum.
   - **EVM Compatibility**: Developers can bring their Ethereum dApps to Polygon without rewriting any code. This is crucial because Ethereum developers favor ZK Roll-Ups, and Polygon’s EVM compatibility is a major advantage.

2. **Polygon ID Solution** 🆔
   - Polygon ID is a platform for decentralized identity, offering features like on-chain reputation and one-person-one-vote enforcement. This solution is a significant step forward in the crypto space.

## 🤝 Part 2: Strong Partnerships and Ecosystem

Polygon has secured several world-class partnerships:

- **Nike** 👟: Nike’s NFT platform, Swoosh, will run on Polygon.
- **Hamilton Lane** 💼: Tokenizing funds on Polygon.
- **Square Enix** 🎮: Creating a Web3 experience with Polygon.
- **Starbucks** ☕: Launching their NFT rewards program on Polygon.

Additionally, Polygon is making moves in the Web3 and DeFi s
